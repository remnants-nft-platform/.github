- 24h in-game marketplace $CMP volume is now displayed in the navigation bar
- Zombies now get infected on chain faster than before. This process has been automised for the most part üßü

[Long period of undocumented changelog]

## [0.4.1.0] - 2022-03-21 üå≠ Hotfix patch

### Added

- Authorization token is now automatically refreshed if user keeps visiting they app every hour or so.
- Discord notifications for infections (will stay inactive for a few more days though)
- Discord notifications for new listings (includes items the listed Remnant owns)
- Option to migrate all of your keys from one wallet to another
- Ledger support
- Our API is public and has it's first actually readable iteration. It will get even more love in the following weeks! In the following days we will also create the #DEV-talks channel for anyone interested in building plugins, browser extensions... you can check the endpoints at: https://remnants-prod-zqgkoqmdwq-uc.a.run.app/api/

### Fixed

- We have migrated from Quiknode to a public genesysgo node. Everything should work now, **but** this will be the **first time stress testing transactions on this public node**. There could be some failed transactions, but we are keeping track of all of them in our database. If gg node turns out not to be a proper solution, we will look for another one, or possibly fix our quiknode setup and rollback to it.

### Coming soon

- @Shishka will put our compensation CRON job live once he is up tonight. Which means whenever you experience a failed transactions or receive no $CMP tokens from "Claim rewards", it should be automatically compensated within 30-60 minutes.
